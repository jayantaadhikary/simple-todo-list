I made this simple & basic to-do list while learning the basics of DOM.

**Click on the item you entered in the list to strike through it. Click the delete option to remove the item from the list.

As time goes by, I might add and implement more features to this project.

ps - Currently, I have kept this project as simple as I can. There is very less HTML and CSS in the project right now and I am planning to improve the design of the page after I add more features to the todo-list.
