Hey guys,
I am a beginner in JavaScript, I started learning DOM (Document Object Model) recently. I made this simple & basic to-do list while learning the basics of DOM.

**You can click on the item you entered in the list to strike through it. It can be usefull in identifying which of the tasks have been completed.
**This To-do list does not contain features like removing items, clearing the whole list, saving data, etc because I still have a lot to learn. 
As time goes by, I will add and implement more features to this project.


ps - Currently, I have kept this project as simple as I can. There is very less HTML and CSS in the project right now and I am planning to improve the design of the page after I add more features to the todo-list. 

Thanks & Regards,
Jayanta Adhikary
